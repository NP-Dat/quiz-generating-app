# Structure Design of Quiz React App

This document outlines the structure and design of the Quiz React application.

## 1. Codebase Structure

The codebase is structured as a typical React application, emphasizing component-based architecture and separation of concerns. The main directories and files are organized as follows:

1.  **`quiz-react-app/public/`**: This folder contains static assets that are served directly by the web server.
    *   **`data/`**: This is crucial for the quiz content.
        *   `*.json` (e.g., `data1.json`, `filemoi.json`): Each JSON file represents a single quiz, containing an array of question objects (question text, answers, correct answer index). The `Quiz.js` component fetches the content of one of these files based on user selection.
        *   `index.json`: This file is automatically generated by the `quiz-react-app/scripts/generate-quiz-list.js` script. It contains a list of all the quiz `.json` filenames found in this directory. The `QuizList.js` component fetches this file to know which quizzes are available to display.
    *   `index.html`: The main HTML page for your single-page application. React injects the application into the `<div id="root">` element within this file.
    *   Other files (`favicon.ico`, `manifest.json`, etc.): Standard assets for web apps (icon, PWA manifest).

2.  **`quiz-react-app/src/`**: This folder holds the core React application code.
    *   **`css/`**: Contains the stylesheets.
        *   `App.css`: Styles the overall application shell (header, footer, main content area) defined in `App.js`.
        *   `index.css`: Global styles applied to the entire application (like body font, margins).
        *   `Quiz.css`: Contains styles specifically for the quiz-taking interface (`Quiz.js`) and the quiz selection list (`QuizList.js`), including question display, answer buttons, score section, review section, and quiz cards.
    *   **`App.js`**: The main component that sets up the application structure. It uses `react-router-dom` to define routes: `/` maps to the `QuizList` component, and `/quiz` maps to the `Quiz` component. It also renders the common header and footer.
    *   **`index.js`**: The entry point of the React application. It imports the main `App` component and renders it into the `root` DOM element defined in `public/index.html`. It also imports the global `index.css`.
    *   **`Quiz.js`**: This component manages the state and logic for an active quiz session. It receives the selected quiz filename from `QuizList.js` via route state, fetches the corresponding JSON data from `public/data/`, displays questions one by one, handles answer clicks, calculates the score, shows the final score, and provides options to restart, review answers, or go back to the list.
    *   **`QuizList.js`**: Fetches the list of quiz filenames from `public/data/index.json`. It then renders this list as interactive cards. Clicking a card navigates the user to the `/quiz` route, passing the chosen quiz filename so the `Quiz` component knows which quiz data to load.
    *   **`reportWebVitals.js`**: A utility provided by Create React App for measuring performance metrics.
    *   **`components/`**: (Currently empty in provided context, but intended for reusable UI components). This directory is intended to house reusable React components that can be used across different parts of the application.
    *   **`context/`**: (Currently empty in provided context, but intended for React Contexts). This directory is likely intended to store React Contexts for managing application-wide state, such as theme or user preferences, if needed in the future.

3.  **`quiz-react-app/scripts/`**: Contains helper scripts used during development or build.
    *   `generate-quiz-list.js`: This Node.js script is automatically run before starting the development server (`npm start`) or building the application (`npm run build`). Its job is to scan the `public/data` directory, find all `.json` files (except `index.json` itself), and write their names into the `public/data/index.json` file. This ensures the quiz list is always up-to-date without manual editing of `index.json`.
